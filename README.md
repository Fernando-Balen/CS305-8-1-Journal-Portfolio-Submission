CS305: 8-1 Journal: Portfolio Submission

**1) Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?**

The client was Artemis Financial, they wanted to modernize their operation with their software and wanted our expertise to examine their web-based software to find security vulnarabitilies.

**What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?**

When a software security vulnerabilitiy was found, I addresed by first checking what that vulnerability affected and how I could take care of it. It's always important for code to be secure so that hack attacks or personal data breaches can be avoided and save the company a headache and money. Software security add's to a compan's overall wellbeing by providing security in that their data and customers are safe behind well written code and security measurements. 

**What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?**

I think that the Maven Dependency Check Plug-in was really helpful when identifing vulnerability in the packages used in the code.

**How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?**

I increased the level of security by seeing what packages needed to be updated with the Maven check, changing encryption to SHA-256 to keep communication secure. In the future I would continue to use the Maven check to assess vulnerabilities. As for the mitigation technique I would use product testing to make sure everything runs well and pass most test cases before launching the web-base program.

**How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?**

I made sure that the code and software was secure by running JUnits test cases on the code while also running the Maven check report and scaning for possible vulnerabilities. I also made sure to use the latest and most recommended encryption available while using keeping my code consistant and efficient. After I refactored the code, I made sure to go over the changes and run a couple test to make sure that no new vulnerabilities were created. 

**What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?**

I used eclipse as my IDE, which is very good and recommended when coding in Java. As for tools the Maven dependency check tool, while maintaining a good coding practice, using comments and logical variable naming.

**Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?**

In the future I can refer back to this project and showcase my experience in using the latest software security vulnerabilities tools, experience in encrypting communication between host and server with SHA-256, creating certificates and their keys, and working with APIs.
